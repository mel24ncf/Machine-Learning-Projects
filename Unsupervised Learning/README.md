# Unsupervised Learning

## Definition:
Unsupervised Machine Learning is the branch of machine learning that is concerned with extracting patterns and insights from data that lacks labels or targets. Unlike supervised machine learning, where models are trained on labeled data, unsupervised learning algorithms explore the data's inherent structure and relationships.

## Types:
### Clustering:
In clustering tasks, the goal is to group data points into clusters based on similarity, without any prior knowledge of the groupings.
Common examples include:
* Customer Segmentation
* Text Clustering

### Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction techiques focus on data reduction, reducing the number of features in the dataset to the most important. 
Common examples include:
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for regression tasks
* Data Visualization
* Recommender Systems

### Anomaly Detection 
Anomaly detection is concentrated on identifying rare events or anomalies within the data set
* Fraud Detection
* Network Security

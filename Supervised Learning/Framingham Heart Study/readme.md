# Framingham Heart Study: Logistic Regression for Coronary Heart Disease Prediction

In this project, I build a logistic regression model to predict whether a person will have a coronary heart disease event in the next decade. 
This prediction takes the following variables into account:

* Male: Boolean Indicator (1-male, 0-female)
* Age: Age of the patient in years
* Education: 
* currentSmoker:
* cigsPerDay:
* BPMeds:
* prevalentStroke:
* prevalentHyp:
* Diabetes:
* totChol:
* sysBP:
* diaBP:
* BMI:
* heartRate:
* Glucose:

This project contains four python files.

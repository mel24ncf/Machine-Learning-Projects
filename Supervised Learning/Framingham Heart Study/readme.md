# Framingham Heart Study: Logistic Regression for Coronary Heart Disease Prediction

## 1. Summary
In this project, I built a classification model using logistic regression, to predict whether a person will have a coronary heart disease event within 10 years.
I also perform threshold analysis to identify the threshold that produces the largest F1 score for the fitted model. The threshold (usually .50) is a parameter that determines the positive class.

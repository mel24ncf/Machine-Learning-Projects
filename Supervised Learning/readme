# Supervised Learning

## Definition:
Supervised Machine Learning is a branch of machine learning that is concerned with algorithms that are trained on labeled datasets. 
The type of labeling determines whether the task is a classification or regression problem.

## Types:
### Classification:
In a classification problem, the goal is to train a computer to correctly assign each instance to its appropriate category 
(or set of categories in multi-label classification). Examples include classifying the following:

  * Survivors of the Titanic
  * Customer Churn
  * Handwritten Digit Recognition
  * Image Classification

### Regression:
Regression problems involve training a computer to predict numerical values. This is used when the output or target is a continuous variable. 
Examples include predictions on the following:

  * House Price 
  * College GPA 
  * Sales 

The main idea here is that we are trying to find the parameters that minimize a chosen Loss function. The Loss function determines a surface over the feature space,
and the parameters behave as coordinates in this space. Finding the best parameters is equivalent to finding the point where this surface has a horizontal tangent
plane. However, the problem is that we cannot visualize dimensions > 3, and our numerical algorithms for locating global minimums can occassionally get stuck at 
local minimums.

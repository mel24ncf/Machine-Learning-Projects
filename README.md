# Machine Learning Projects

This is a repository to showcase some of the Machine Learning projects that I have worked on while pursuing an MS in Applied Data Science. 
The folder structure is setup in the following way:

* Deep Learning
  * MLP
  * CNN
  * RNN

* Supervised Learning
  * Classification
  * Regression

* Unsupervised Learning
  * Clustering
  * PCA

Folder for branch of ML, subfolder for topic, subfolder for a particular project.

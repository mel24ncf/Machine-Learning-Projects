# Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of my projects, which includes assignments from my Applied Machine Learning course and personal projects that I have passionately worked on.

The file structure of this repo follows this diagram:

├── Deep Learning/

│   ├── project2/
│   ├── ...
├── Supervised Learning/
│   ├── project1/
│   ├── project2/
│   ├── ...
├── Unsupervised Learning/
|   ├── project1/
|   ├── project2/
├── README.md

Each project folder contains files for the data and machine learning code.
